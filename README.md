# React Website with GSAP and TailwindCSS

This is a React-based website project aimed at learning and implementing GSAP animations, along with leveraging other modern web development tools and libraries.

## Project Overview

The website is built to explore GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for creating smooth, interactive animations in a React environment. The project follows the tutorial from JavaScript Mastery, which can be found here: [YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/zA9r5zTllx4?si=J_4LZq2OIqBhe_e7).

## Features
- **GSAP Animations**: Smooth, high-performance animations.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Vite**: Fast development build tool.
- **React Icons**: Pre-built, customizable icons.
- **React-use**: Collection of essential React Hooks.

## Library/Dependencies
- **GSAP**: Animation library.
- **react-icons**: Icon library for React.
- **react-use**: Collection of React Hooks ([GitHub](https://github.com/streamich/react-use)).
